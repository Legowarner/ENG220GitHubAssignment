Our project was to create a simple calculator in C and to test some things for the final project

## Contributions 
- Andrew Eames created the inital commit being a hello world program in c, setting up the base boilerplate
- Emma Smiset-Ortiz updated helloworld.c to become an adder.
- Cyprian Albano created a Streamlit app as a test for the final project
- Nicholas Starr updated HelloWorld.c into a full fledged calculator
- Lamar Elliot updated the readme file into it's first edition
- Andrew Eames updated the readme file into it's final version

## Final Conclusion
The instructions on the readme file were slightly unclear, The Project Lead was unsure exactly where this project needed to go and thus it became more scatterbrained than probably what was intended in the instructions.
